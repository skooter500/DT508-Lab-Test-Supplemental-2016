# Game Programming Supplemental Lab Test 2016

## Instructions
- Start with a blank Processing sketch
- You can use any examples from your git repo, my git repo and use the Processing reference
- No use of Google or Facebook and no conferring
- When you are finished, submit the link to your git repo.
- If you are not confident you can use git, then zip up your code and submit it through webcources
- Remember to save and commit often!
- You have 3 hours

Today you will be making this Processing sketch (video link):

Whats happening:

- There are 200 randomly and positioned and coloured stars drawn in the top half of the screen. Notice that these do not flicker or change positions each frame.
- The UFO is controlled with the arrow keys. The UFO should not be able to move beyond the bounds of the screen, or go passed the green area.
- The circles on the UFO should change from red to green every second
- There are 5 red "people" they should be created from top to bottom in the green area at random x positions. 
Each person on the screen can decide whether to move left to right or right to left based on a random value. 
When the person reaches the left or right side of the screen they should change direction.

Here is the marking scheme:

| Description | Marks |
|-------------|-------|
| Implementing the stars & drawing the scene| 20 |
| Implementing the UFO | 35 |
| Implementing people | 30 |
| Use of git | 15 |

You should create a new git repository for your work today and make at least 5 commits over the duration of the test to get full marks for use of git. When you are done, submit your git repo link. If you are not confident in using git, you can altarnatively submit a zip file of your work through webcourses. 

To get full marks, you should use classes, PVectors and Polymorphism in your solution, but alternative solutions are also acceptable for fewer marks.

- [Submit your git repo link here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1m7oIH1u7tkRS8lb2iEYmymxdhZNQQz3wd2bSd8w5E5k/viewform)
- (If you cant figure out git, you can submit a zip file of your code here)[http://www.dit.ie/lttc/webcourseslogin/]
